This Repository contains my **profiles**, **extensions** and **nbextensions** for ipython.

To use it, just clone it, change into the directory and run `INSTALL.sh`.

Afterwards install Mathjax: `python -m IPython.external.mathjax`

The extensions are mainly collected from
[minrk/ipython_extensions](https://github.com/minrk/ipython_extensions) and
[ipython-contrib/IPython-notebook-extensions](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/IPython-notebook-extensions)
